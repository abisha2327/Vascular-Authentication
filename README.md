# Vascular-Authentication 
Authentication, the process of attesting the genuine information of a person or process. This technology provides access control for systems by checking if a personâ€™s credentials match to the credentials in the database of that person. There is a growing demand for different types of user authentication technologies for both online and in physical systems. The available sorts of authentication techniques: password base login, multifactor, biometric (fingerprint, retina, facial, voice recognition), token-based, certificated-based. The proposed idea is CONTACTLESS VASCULAR AUTHENTICATION otherwise known as Palm Vein Biometric. This technology works by comparing the pattern of veins in the palm of a person that appear as blue lines that is been authenticated with a pattern stored in a database. It is processed by illuminating an infrared light to map the unique vein structure in the palm, which in turn gives the exact accurate structure of the vein. The database of the vascular authentication is managed using sqlite3.
